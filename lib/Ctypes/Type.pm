    my $int = c_int(10);

    $$int = 15;                          # Note the double sigil
    $$int += 3;
    print $int->size;                    # sizeof(int) in C
    print $int->name;                    # 'c_int'

    my $array = Array( 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 );  #Create array (of c_ushort)
    my $dblarray = Array( c_double, [ 2, 1, 0, -1, -2 ] );
    $$dblarray[2] = $$int;               # Again, note sigils
    print $dblarray->size;               # sizeof(type) * #members

    # Create int-type pointer to double-type array
    my $intp = Pointer( c_int, $dblarray );
    print $$intp[2];                     # 1073741824 on my system

=head1 ABSTRACT

Ctypes::Type is the base class for classes representing the
simple C types, as well as L<Arrays|Ctypes::Type::Array>,
L<Pointers|Ctypes::Type::Pointer>, L<Structs|Ctypes::Type::Struct>
and L<Unions|Ctypes::Type::Union> (although there are functions for
all of them in the main L<Ctypes> namespace, so you can normally
just C<use Ctypes;>).

Common methods are documented here. See the relevant documentation
for the above packages for more detailed information.

=head1 METHODS

Apart from its value or values, each Ctypes::Type object holds various pieces of
information about itself, which you can access via the methods below. Some are
only I<get methods> (read-only), but some could be misused to greatly confuse
the object internals, so you shouldn't assign to them lightly.

=over

=item data

Returning a I<reference> to the object's data field, where its value is
held in L<pack|perlfunc/"pack">ed form. This was originally designed
for internal use, so the semantics are likely to change in future, as
handing out direct access to the data field isn't a good default for
such an innocuously named method.

=cut

#
# Hello! Currently classes implement their own data() methods.
# Looking into commonalities and whether they can be abstracted
# in some way is still TODO.
#

=item index

Returns the offset of the object into its 'owner' object, if it
has one (i.e. an Array, Struct or Union).

=cut

sub index {
  return $_[0]->{_index};
}

sub _set_index {
  $_[0]->{_index} = $_[1] if defined $_[1]; return $_[0]->{_index};
}

=item name

Accessor returning the 'name' of the Type instance ('c_int', 'c_double',
etc.).

B<Note> The use of the C<name> attribute is currently quite
inconsistent. It's used in places it shouldn't be. There should be some
kind of C<Ctypes::are_like()> function to do a deep equivalence check
for data types. At that time C<name> will become simpler. Until then
though, the following rules apply:

Since all basic types are currently Ctypes::Type::Simple objects,
the C<name> attribute is how you find out what kind of type you
actually have.

For compound data types, the name will tell you something about the
object's contents.

For Arrays, C<name> is the lowercased C<name> of the type of object
contained in the array, minus any leading 'c_', plus the suffix '_Array',
e.g. 'int_Array'.

For Pointers, C<name> is the lowercased C<name> of the type of object
being pointed to, minus any leading 'c_', plus the suffix '_Pointer',
e.g. 'int_array_Pointer'.

In the case of Structs, the preceeding convention could get out of hand
(even quicker than it does with the others), so C<name> consists of the
typecodes of the Struct's constituent types, in order, concatenated
together, plus the suffix '_Struct'. So a Struct of three unsigned ints
and two signed doubles would have the name 'iiiDD_Struct' (of course,
this can't be relied upon for checking equivalence, as all compound
Types have the typecode 'p').

=cut

sub name   { return $_[0]->{_name}  }
sub _set_name { die unless scalar @_ == 2; return $_[0]->{_name} = $_[1] }

=item owner

Return the object's 'owner' object, i.e. the Array, Struct or Union
of which it is currently part. Returns undef if the object isn't
inside any others.

=cut

sub owner { return $_[0]->{_owner} }
sub _set_owner {
  $_[0]->{_owner} = $_[1] if defined $_[1]; return $_[0]->{_owner};
}

=item size

Accessor returning the size in bytes on your system of the C type
represented by the Type object. For example, a c_int object might
have size 4, and an Array of five of them would have size 20.

=cut

sub size   { exists $_[0]->{_size} ? $_[0]->{_size} : Ctypes::sizeof($_[0]->sizecode) }
sub _set_size { return $_[0]->{_size} = $_[1] }

=item typecode

Accessor returning the 'typecode' of the Type instance. A typecode
is a 1-character string used internally for representing different
C types, which might be useful for various things.

=cut

sub typecode { $_[0]->{_typecode} }
# See Simple
#sub packcode { $_[0]->{_typecode} }
#sub sizecode { $_[0]->{_typecode} }

=item validate

Calls the _hook_store() callback method, which checks types and limits on write.

=cut

sub validate {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->_hook_store(@_);
}

=head1 CLASS FUNCTIONS

=over

=item strict_input_all

This class method can cease all toleration of incorrect input
for all Type objects. Sets/returns 1 or 0. See the
L<strict_input/Ctypes::Type::Simple/strict_input> object method
for how to do this to individual objects

=cut

  my $strict_input_all = 0;

    # ??? This could be improved; could still be called as a class method
    # with an object instead of a 1 or 0 and user would not be notified
    my $arg = shift;
